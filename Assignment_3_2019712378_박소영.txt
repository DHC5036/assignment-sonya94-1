1. Can you design a learnable positional encoding method?
Yes.

2. What can be challenges to Transformers if input sequences are very long? why?
If the input sequences are very long, the cost can be high. Becasue the memory of transformer and computation requirements grow in a quadratic way due to bottleneecks.
